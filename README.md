# WIP:Nats-chat-server

[Nats](https://nats.io/) is probably not needed for all this fun goodness, but I want to experiment with it, so why not.
This is a Chat message subscription service meant to copy the functionality of the [Streamlabs-twitch chat bot](https://streamlabs.com/). The key difference that user input will come from a variety of sources before going to the publish ui. Probably doesn't need Nats but we want it. 

## TODO:
* ~Test out Nats server with connection and publishing~
* Get user input to nats server
* add twitter/twitch/discord/slack api consumption
* add moderator interface
* publish chat to web address.
